## What is Local Skills MCP?

A **universal** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables **any LLM or AI agent** to access expert skills from your local filesystem. Write skills once, use them across Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cline, Continue.dev, custom agents, or any MCP-compatible client.

Transform AI capabilities with structured, expert-level instructions for specialized tasks. Context-efficient lazy loading—only skill names/descriptions load initially (~50 tokens/skill), full content on-demand.

### 🆚 Why Use Local Skills MCP?

| Feature           | Local Skills MCP                | Built-in Claude Skills   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Portability**   | Any MCP client                  | Claude Code only         |
| **Storage**       | Multiple directories aggregated | `~/.claude/skills/` only |
| **Invocation**    | Explicit via MCP tool           | Auto-invoked by Claude   |
| **Context Usage** | Lazy loading (names only)       | All skills in context    |

## ✨ Features

- **🌐 Universal** - Works with any MCP client (Claude Code/Desktop, Cline, Continue.dev, custom agents)
- **🔄 Portable** - Write once, use across multiple AI systems and LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Ollama, etc.)
- **⚡ Context Efficient** - Lazy loading (~50 tokens/skill for names/descriptions, full content loads on-demand)
- **🔥 Hot Reload** - Changes apply instantly without restart (new skills, edits, deletions)
- **🎯 Multi-Source** - Auto-aggregates from built-in skills, `~/.claude/skills`, `./.claude/skills`, `./skills`, custom paths
- **📦 Zero Config** - Works out-of-the-box with standard locations
- **✨ Focused API** - Three tools: `get_skill` to load one, `validate_skill` to check a SKILL.md, `evaluate_skill` to measure how reliably it triggers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

**Requirements:** Node.js 22+

Choose one installation method:

```bash
# From npm (recommended)
npm install -g local-skills-mcp

# Or clone and build locally
git clone https://github.com/kdpa-llc/local-skills-mcp.git
cd local-skills-mcp
npx --yes npm@11 ci  # Use the same npm major as CI
npm run build  # Creates dist/index.js for the local MCP client configuration below
```

For source builds, use a current Node.js 22 or 24 release. The build step is required: the `prepare` script only installs Git hooks.

### 2. Configure MCP Client

Add to your MCP client configuration:

**For Claude Code/Desktop** (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` or `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-skills": {
      "command": "local-skills-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cline:** VS Code Settings → "Cline: MCP Settings" (same JSON structure)

**For other MCP clients:** Use the same command/args structure

**If cloned locally** (not installed globally), use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-skills": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/local-skills-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Skill Discovery:**

The server auto-aggregates skills from multiple directories (priority: low to high):

1. Package built-in skills (self-documenting guides)
2. `~/.claude/skills/` - Global skills
3. `./.claude/skills/` - Project-specific (hidden)
4. `./skills` - Project-specific (visible)
5. `$SKILLS_DIR` - Custom path (if env var set)

Later directories override earlier ones, letting you customize built-in skills.

### 3. Create & Use Skills

**Create Skills (Option 1: Ask AI - Recommended)**

Simply ask your AI to create skills:

```
"Create a Python expert skill for clean, idiomatic code"
"Make a PR review skill focusing on security and best practices"
```

The AI uses the built-in `skill-creator` skill to generate well-structured skills with proper YAML frontmatter and trigger keywords.

**Create Skills (Option 2: Manual)**

Create `~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

You are an expert at [domain]. Your task is to [specific task].

Guidelines:

1. Be specific and actionable
2. Provide examples
3. Include best practices
```

**Use Skills**

Request any skill: `"Use the my-skill skill"`

Skills are auto-discovered and load on-demand. **All changes apply instantly** with hot reload—no restart needed!

## 📝 SKILL.md Format

Every skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

Your skill instructions in Markdown format...
```

**Required Fields:**

- `name` - Skill identifier (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)
- `description` - Critical for skill selection (max 200 chars)

**Writing Effective Descriptions:**

Use pattern: `[What it does]. Use when [trigger conditions/keywords].`

✅ **Good Examples:**

- "Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes."
- "Analyzes Excel spreadsheets and creates pivot tables. Use when working with .xlsx files or tabular data."

❌ **Poor Example:**

- "Helps with Excel files"

Specific trigger keywords help the AI make better decisions when selecting skills.

## 🎯 Usage

**How It Works:**

1. AI sees all available skill names/descriptions (auto-updated, ~50 tokens each)
2. When you request a skill, AI invokes the `get_skill` tool
3. Full skill content loads on-demand with detailed instructions

**Built-in Skills:**

Three self-documenting skills are included:

- `local-skills-mcp-usage` - Quick usage guide
- `local-skills-mcp-guide` - Comprehensive documentation
- `skill-creator` - Skill authoring best practices

**Skill Directories:**

Auto-aggregates from multiple locations (later ones override earlier):

1. Package built-in skills
2. `~/.claude/skills/` - Global skills
3. `./.claude/skills/` - Project-specific (hidden)
4. `./skills` - Project-specific (visible)
5. `$SKILLS_DIR` - Custom path (optional)

**Custom Directory:**

Configure via environment variable in your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-skills": {
      "command": "local-skills-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SKILLS_DIR": "/custom/path/to/skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Skill:**

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for best practices, bugs, and security. Use when reviewing PRs or analyzing code quality.
---

You are a code reviewer with expertise in software engineering best practices.

Analyze the code for:

1. Correctness and bugs
2. Best practices and maintainability
3. Performance and security issues

Provide specific, actionable feedback with examples.
```

## 🔗 Complementary Projects

**Optimize your MCP setup with these complementary tools:**

### [MCP Compression Proxy][mcp-tool-aggregator]

**Discover and access tools from multiple MCP servers**

While Local Skills MCP provides reusable prompt instructions, [MCP Compression Proxy][mcp-tool-aggregator] connects multiple MCP servers through one gateway. Its CLI loads selected tool schemas on demand; its native MCP mode shortens descriptions while keeping input schemas visible.

**Use them together:**

- **Local Skills MCP** - Expert skills with lazy loading (~50 tokens/skill)
- **MCP Compression Proxy** - Progressive tool discovery and description compression

Context savings depend on your tool schemas, client mode, and task. Measure the complete tool definitions used by your own setup.
